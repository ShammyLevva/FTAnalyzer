## FTAnalyzer Releases  

If you prefer a manual install method, you can [download the latest version](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer/releases) from the releases page.

This file uses the built in Windows Installer from Microsoft to install the application and create a shortcut in the start menu and on the Desktop. 

NB. My apologies that this is the default windows installer so it doesn't have much customisability. It does however work, and importantly is free for me to use, so it is easier for me to distribute than paying to buy a proper installer application.
