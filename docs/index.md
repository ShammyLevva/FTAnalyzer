Family Tree Analyzer
====================

#### Install the latest Windows version FREE from the [Offical Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PMJL9HVPL7X?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge). This version will automatically update as new versions become available.  

If you have [issues with the Windows Store](http://www.ftanalyzer.com/ResetWindowsStore) or have a older version of Windows you can [download a stand alone installer version here](http://ftanalyzer.com/releases). This version is identical to the Windows Store version but it will require you to manually update to get the latest changes. It does however allow you to run the program on pre-Windows 10 versions of Windows, however as time passes the ability to keep it working on really old versions of Windows may stop working.

#### If you have a Mac search for FTAnalyzer on the Mac App Store for your region or for a beta version click [here.](http://mac.ftanalyzer.com)  

The simplest Windows 10 install method is to install from the Offical Microsoft App Store. This will then auto update the application when a new version comes out assuming you've not turned off this option in the Microsoft App Store app.  

Installation is simple with Windows Store Click the link and click Get to get the application or Launch to run the application once installed. Note occassionally the Windows Store glitches and shows you own the product but it's not installed. If this happens follow [these instructions](http://www.ftanalyzer.com/ResetWindowsStore) to fix the problem.  

You can put a short cut on your desktop by dragging the icon from your start menu to the desktop. [This article](https://winaero.com/blog/desktop-shortcut-store-app-windows-10/) explains if you are having issues creating a shortcut icon.
  
### Helpful Guides to Using FTAnalyzer

There is now a series of helpful guides to downloading, installing and using FTAnalyzer. You can get them from [here](/guides "FTAnalyzer Guides") note these guides were created a while ago so the screen shots are a bit dated.

### Documentation Website

The [documentation](./Documentation) is similarly in need of some updating. It's a work in progress and I tend to focus on new features rather than documentation. If anyone would like to assist updating the documentation I'd be happy to accept their assistance. 

### Facebook, Support Site & Twitter

The [Support website](https://www.facebook.com/FTAnalyzer) is hosted as a page on Facebook. The [User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ftanalyzer) is also on Facebook. The Twitter account is @FTAnalyzer note I don't check twitter very often so easiest is to raise an issue on the [issues site](http://www.ftanalyzer.com/issues)

### Initial Features

This program is under constant development and suggestions for improvements and new features are very welcome. Please add suggestions via the Issues tab and add suggestion in the subject. There are Help pages available under the Documentation tab.

### Census Research Suggestions and Census Searching

You can view the colour census report via the colour reports tab it lists everyone you choose to filter and shows the various UK census years. This list is then colour coded to show :

*   grey - they weren't alive on that census
*   red \- they were alive but you have yet to enter a CENSus or RESIdence fact for them.
*   yellow \- you have entered a census but you have not yet tagged the census as having been entered on the Lost Cousins website.
*   green \- you have entered a census and it isn't a Lost Cousins census year or is a Lost Cousins year and you have entered data on lost Cousins website.
*   orange \- you have added the details to Lost Cousins but not added the census data yet

The red and yellow boxes where there are missing census records are clickable. Select the website you want to search from the drop down box at the top of the report and then double click on a red box. This will then open up a search results page on Ancestry, FreeCen, FindMyPast or FamilySearch thus making it a quick and easy way to search the census records.

Similarly on the regular census reports clicking on the name of a person to find will try to look up that person on whichever site you have selected. Note you need to login to the site before clicking the person and have a subscription to use Ancestry or FindMyPast census searches.

### Notes

All feedback welcome. Please note this is very much a work in progress, it works for my own Gedcom file however there is no guarantee that other ways of recording data will be consistently handled. If you wish to post error logs and log issues please include a sample gedcom file that demonstrates the problem you are having. I'd like to ensure that it works consistently for every user. Please also note that there is a bias in the program for UK searching as that is where my Ancestors are from. So some defaults may need to be tweaked or turned into user configurable options in later versions. Again let me know what works and what causes you problems.
